## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need **Jupyter Notebook** installed to run this project. If you don't have it, you can install it as part of the Anaconda distribution:

* **Anaconda:** [https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

### Installation and Execution

2.  **Upload to Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Open **Jupyter Notebook**.
    * Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.
    * Upload the entire project folder to your Jupyter Notebook environment.
